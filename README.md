# Scenarios

## Scenario 1: Practical implementation of governance with Blueprints, Azure Policies, RBAC and ARM

TBD - implement data security policies (encryption), data access policies (RBAC, enforcing AAD authentication for data plane), secure network access to data and package everything as Azure Blueprint

## Scenario 2: Selecting right storage for different needs and types of data

TBD - identify when to use Blob storage, Data Lake, Cosmos DB, SQL, Event Hub, multi-region solutions, using read replicas etc.

## Scenario 3: Moving data

TBD - identify when to use Data Box, Data Box Edge, Azure Files Sync, Data Factory, Stream Analytics export, Logic Apps etc.

## Scenario 4: Designing structured data analysis solution

TBD - design data warehouse and PowerBI

## Scenario 5: Designing semi-structured and unstructured data analysis solution

TBD - design Azure Data Bricks

## Scenario 6: Designing Machine Learning and Cognitive Services

TBD - design custom ML models, model governance and DevOps, position cognitive services
